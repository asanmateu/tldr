# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in tldr!

## How to help right now

The most valuable contribution at this stage is **using tldr and telling us what's off**. The core functionality is in place, but it needs real-world feedback to get sharp.

Specifically:

- **Report anything that doesn't work** — broken extractions, garbled summaries, crashes, weird edge cases.
- **Flag what doesn't feel useful** — if a summary style misses the point, or the output is too long/short/vague, that's worth reporting.
- **Point out redundancy** — if two features overlap or a setting never makes sense to change, let us know.

The goal is to fulfill tldr's main purpose — making content easy to understand — and do it better with each iteration. QA feedback shapes that more than new features right now.

## Reporting issues

Open an issue on the repo with:

1. What you ran (command, input type, flags)
2. What happened
3. What you expected

Screenshots or copied output are always helpful.

## Code contributions

If you want to contribute code, open an issue first to discuss the change. This keeps effort focused and avoids duplicate work.
